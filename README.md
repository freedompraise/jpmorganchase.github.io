| cf-shap                 | Counterfactual SHAP: a framework for counterfactual feature importance. It is a framework for counterfactual feature importance that leverages the Shapley value, a well-known concept from cooperative game theory, to quantify the marginal contribution of each feature to the prediction outcome under different counterfactual scenarios.
